// FEATURE REQUEST
// 1. Arithmetic Operation Script: Write a script that performs basic Arithmetic Operations(addition, subtraction, multiplication, devision, reminder) on two numbers and logs the results
// 2. Comparison and logical operation script: Create a script the pcompares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results
// 3. Ternary Operator Script: Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result
