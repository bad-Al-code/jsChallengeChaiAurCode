## Files

- **arithmeticOperations.js**: Script performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logging the results.
- **comparisonAndLogicalOperations.js**: Script comparing two numbers using various comparison operators and combining conditions using logical operators, logging the results
- **ternaryOperator.js**: Script using the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative, logging the result.

## Description

#### `arithmeticOperations.js`

This script demonstrates basic arithmetic operations on two numbers:

1. Addition: Adds two numbers and logs the result.
1. Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first and logs the result.
1. Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers and logs the result.
1. Division: Divides the first number by the second and logs the result.
1. Remainder: Finds the remainder when the first number is divided by the second and logs the result.

#### `comparisonAndLogicalOperations.js`

This script compares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators:

1. Greater than and Less than: Compares two numbers using > and <, logging the results.
1. Greater than or equal to and Less than or equal to: Compares two numbers using >= and <=, logging the results.
1. Equality and Strict Equality: Compares two numbers using == and ===, logging the results.
1. Logical AND (&&): Combines two conditions and logs the result.
1. Logical OR (||): Combines two conditions and logs the result.
1. Logical NOT (!): Negates a condition and logs the result.

#### `ternaryOperator.js`

This script uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result:

- Positive or Negative Check: Uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative, logging the result.
