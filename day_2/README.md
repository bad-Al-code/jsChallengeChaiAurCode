## Description

### `1_arithmeticOperationScript.js` and `ts/1_arithmeticOperationScript.ts`

These scripts demonstrate basic arithmetic operations on two numbers:

1. **Addition**: Adds two numbers and logs the result.
2. **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first and logs the result.
3. **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers and logs the result.
4. **Division**: Divides the first number by the second and logs the result.
5. **Remainder**: Finds the remainder when the first number is divided by the second and logs the result.

### `2_comparisonAndLogicalOperations.js` and `ts/2_comparisonAndLogicalOperations.ts`

These scripts compare two numbers using different comparison operators and combine conditions using logical operators:

1. **Greater than and Less than**: Compares two numbers using `>` and `<`, logging the results.
2. **Greater than or equal to and Less than or equal to**: Compares two numbers using `>=` and `<=`, logging the results.
3. **Equality and Strict Equality**: Compares two numbers using `==` and `===`, logging the results.
4. **Logical AND (`&&`)**: Combines two conditions and logs the result.
5. **Logical OR (`||`)**: Combines two conditions and logs the result.
6. **Logical NOT (`!`)**: Negates a condition and logs the result.

### `3_ternaryOperator.js` and `ts/3_ternaryOperator.ts`

These scripts use the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and log the result:

- **Positive or Negative Check**: Uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative, logging the result.
