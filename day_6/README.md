## Activities

### Activity 1: Array Creation and Access

1. Create an array of numbers from 1 to 5 and log the array to the console.
2. Access the first and last element of the array and log them to the console.

### Activity 2: Array Methods (Basic)

1. Use the `push` method to add a new number to the end of the array and log the updated array.
2. Use the `pop` method to remove the last element from the array and log the updated array.
3. Use the `shift` method to remove the first element from the array and log the updated array.
4. Use the `unshift` method to add a new element at the beginning of the array and log the updated array.

### Activity 3: Array Methods (Intermediate)

1. Use the `map` method to create a new array where each number is doubled and log the new array.
2. Use the `filter` method to create a new array with only even numbers and log the new array.
3. Use the `reduce` method to calculate the sum of all numbers in the array and log the result.

### Activity 4: Array Iteration

1. Use a `for` loop to iterate over the array and log each element to the console.
2. Use the `forEach` method to iterate over the array and log each element to the console.

### Activity 5: Multi-Dimensional Array

1. Create a 2D array (matrix) and log the entire array to the console.
2. Access and log a specific element from the 2D array.
