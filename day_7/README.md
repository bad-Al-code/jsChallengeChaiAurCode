# Day 7 - Object Operations and Methods

## Activities

### Activity 1: Object Creation and Access

- Create an object representing a book with properties like `title`, `author`, and `year` and log the object to the console.
- Access and log the `title` and `author` properties of the book object.

### Activity 2: Object Methods

- Add a method to the book object that returns a string with the book's title and author, and log the result of calling this method.
- Add a method to the book object that takes a parameter (`year`) and updates the book's year property, then log the updated object.

### Activity 3: Nested Objects

- Create a nested object representing a library with properties like `name` and `books` (an array of book objects), and log the library object to the console.
- Access and log the name of the library and the titles of all the books in the library.

### Activity 4: The this Keyword

- Add a method to the book object that uses the `this` keyword to return a string with the book's title and year, and log the result of calling this method.

### Activity 5: Object Iteration

- Use a `for...in` loop to iterate over the properties of the book object and log each property and its value.
- Use `Object.keys` and `Object.values` methods to log all the keys and values of the book object.
